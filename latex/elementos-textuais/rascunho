Pensamento computacional nasce da constatação da autora sobre a forma como tem sido resolvido como problemas tem sido resolvidos nos mais variados domínios.

Adotar uma postura para resolução de problemas, baseando-se em elementos da ciência da computação.

"Computational Thinking is the thought processes involved in formulating problems and their solutions so that the solutions are represented in a form that can be effectively carried out by an information-processing agent."

Computational thinking is a way of solving problems, designing systems, and understanding human behavior that draws on concepts fundamental to computer science. To flourish in today's world, computational thinking has to be a fundamental part of the way people think and understand the world. 
Computational thinking means creating and making use of different levels of abstraction, to understand and solve problems more effectively. 

Computational thinking means thinking algorithmically and with the ability to apply mathematical concepts such as induction to develop more efficient, fair, and secure solutions. 

Computational thinking means understanding the consequences of scale, not only for reasons of efficiency but also for economic and social reasons.

COMPUTING IS THE AUTOMATION OF OUR ABSTRACTION. (THEY GIVE US THE ABILITY TO SCALE)

Um dos reflexos da relevância econômica da forma de pensar computacionalmente é a intensa incorporação de mestres e doutores em ciência da computação em wall street.
