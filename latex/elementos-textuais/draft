sO MANY OF THE IMPORTANT PROBLEMS THAT WE FACE TODAY ARE COMPLEX, INVOLVING MULTIPLE VARIABLES, NUMEROUS DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS, AND ARE COMPRISED OF MANY, INTERDE- PENDENT PARTS. 

Múltiplos problemas com quais lidamos atualmente envolvem um conjunto numeroso de componentes que se inter-conectam e inter-relacionam. A habilidade de concebê-los sob essa perspectivas configura o que se denomina como ``pensamento sistêmico'', e se diferencia essencialmente das formas de análise tradicional, com as quais os comportamentos individuais das partes são tomadas como simples agregadores do todo. Assim, surge a noção de que certas propriedades resultantes não podem ser explicadas sem que sejam considerados a atividade integral do sistema. 


No contexto de uma sociedade em que a disponibilidade de dados é abundante - onde expressões como \textit{big data} ganham força - emergem métodos de análise suportados pela premissa que sistemas devem ser estudados, investigados, e entendidos no seu conjunto, e não em função das suas partes.

De fato, muitos dos conceitos e modelos e físicos, existentes há décadas, estão estruturado pela compreendidos através

‘‘tHE ABILITY TO THINK SYSTEMICALLY IS AN IMPORTANT HABIT OF MIND THAT SUPPORTS NOT ONLY THE SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND OF THE DEVELOPING stem WORKFORCE, BUT ALSO FUTURE SCIENTIFICALLY LITERATE CITIZENS.

 iN A GLOBAL SOCIETY WHERE FUTURE LARGE-SCALE, SCIENTIFICALLY BASED DECISIONS WILL NEED TO BE MADE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE GENERAL POPULOUS TO DEVELOP A SYSTEMS THINKING ORIENTATION TOWARD THE WORLD’’ (dUSCHL AND bISMACK 2013, P. 120). 

 tHE SYSTEMS THINKING APPROACH IS FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL FORMS OF PROBLEM SOLVING AND FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING HOW SYSTEMS CHANGE OVER TIME (fORRESTER 1968). 

 tHE SYSTEMS THINKING APPROACH HAS HAD TWO DISTINCT FOCI, WITH ONE FOCUS ON AGGREGATE SYSTEMS DYNAMICS (fORRESTER 1968; sTERMAN 2000) AND THE OTHER ON AGENT-BASED DYNAMICS (ePSTEIN AND aXTELL 1996; gRIMM ET AL. 2005; wILENSKY AND rESNICK 1999; wILENSKY AND rAND 2015). 

 Both kinds of systems exhibit emergent behaviors (Bar-Yam 2003; Jacobson and Wilensky 2006; Sterman 2000; Wilensky and Resnick 1999). 

 wITH THE EMERGENCE OF SO MANY CHALLENGES RELATED TO BIG DATA, MANY SYSTEMS THINKING METHODS HAVE BECOME CRITICAL COMPONENTS OF COMPUTATIONAL THINKING APPROACHES PRACTICED ACROSS SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES. 

 tRADITIONAL ANALYSES FOCUS ON BREAKING DOWN PROBLEMS INTO THEIR CONSTITUENT PARTS AND LOOKING SEPARATELY AT THE INDIVIDUAL PIECES. 

 SYS- TEMS THINKING ANALYSES, IN CONTRAST, FOCUS ON AN INCLUSIVE EXAMINATION OF HOW THE SYSTEM AND ITS CONSTITUENT PARTS INTERACT AND RELATE TO ONE ANOTHER AS A WHOLE (aSSARAF AND oRION 2005). 

 mANY FUNDAMENTAL (AND DIFFICULT) SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS ARE BEST, AND PERHAPS ONLY, UNDERSTOOD THROUGH A SYSTEMS LENS. 

 GOOD EXAMPLES INCLUDE NATURAL SELECTION AND POPULATION DYNAMICS IN ECOLOGY, THE HUMAN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM FROM BIOLOGY, AND THE IDEAL GAS LAWS IN CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS (hMELO ET AL. 2000; sTIEFF AND wILENSKY 2003; wILENSKY AND rEISMAN 2006). 

 Other types ofOther types of systems, such as those encountered in physics, economics, and even history, involve cross-cutting concepts related to systems thinking such as feedback, emergence, stocks, and flows (Goldstone and Wilensky 2008; Penner 2000; Wilensky and Rand 2015; Zuckerman and Resnick 2003). 

 Recommendations for the systems perspective are now represented in four separate NRC reports—Taking Science to School (NRC 2007), A Framework for K-12 Science Education (NRC 2012a), Ed- ucation for Life and Work (NRC 2012c) and Discipline- Based Education Research (NRC 2012b) as well as the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States 2013). 

 wHILE THIS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT NECESSARILY BOUND TO COMPU- TATIONAL THINKING, COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS ENABLE NEW WAYS TO EXPLORE, UNDERSTAND, AND REPRESENT THESE IDEAS (bAR-yAM 2003; sTERMAN 2000; wOLFRAM 2002). 

 cOMPUTATION THERE- FORE SERVES AS A POWERFUL MEDIUM TO MAKE THESE IDEAS ACCESSIBLE TO LEARNERS (kLOPFER 2003; wILENSKY 2001). 

 In our analysis of computational thinking activities designed for high school mathematics and science classes, eight lessons included developing practices associated with systems thinking. 

 tHESE FINDINGS WERE REINFORCED BY THE INTERVIEWS WE CONDUCTED WITH SCIENTISTS AND MATHEMATI- CIANS, AS THEY FREQUENTLY CITED CONCEPTS FROM COMPLEX SYSTEMS AND PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH INVESTIGATING AND UNDERSTANDING SYSTEMS THROUGH COMPUTATION AS BEING IMPORTANT IN THEIR FIELD. 

 While many of the computationalpractices that we describe above are valuable for investi- gating systems, this section introduces five computational thinking practices that focus on systems thinking.
